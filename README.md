# Alzheimer's Classification Ensemble  

This repository contains the source code, experimentation results, and trained models for the paper titled *"ADNI Ensemble,"* currently submitted to IEEE INDISCON 2025.  

This experimentation was conducted on Kaggle. To reproduce or modify it in a different environment, necessary changes are required. The dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) must be installed using the following command:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After successful installation, run [env_test.py](env_test.py) to verify that the installed versions meet the requirements.
